---++ Introduction

Translating an Attempto DRS into Web Ontology Language (OWL 2),
or if this fails then to Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL).

The OWL syntax generated by =|drs_to_owlswrl|= conforms to
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-owl2-syntax-20091027/>
but the notation used is Prolog-compatible (e.g. OWL lists and sets
are denoted by Prolog lists).

Various serializations are provided by:

* =|owlfss_owlxml|=: XML form (<http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-owl2-xml-serialization-20091027/>)
* =|owlfss_ascii|=: pretty-printed form (this is just for presentation, don't try to parse it!)
* @deprecated: =|owlfss_owlrdfxml|=: RDF/XML form (<http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-owl2-mapping-to-rdf-20091027/>)

For SWRL rules we use the functional and XML-based syntaxes that are described in
<http://www.webont.org/owled/2009/papers/owled2009_submission_16.pdf>.

The XML-based syntax as been tested with OWL-API v3.

---++ Documentation

For the documentation see:

Note that this thesis uses the label "OWL 1.1" to discuss OWL 2.
This is because OWL 1.1 used to be the name of OWL 2 until April 2008.

Also, see the PlDoc documentation inside the translator files.

---++ Example

Here is a complex (but nonsense) example that the ACE->OWL/SWRL translator can handle
(by translating it into OWL 2). Some layout is added to make it more readable.

==
If there is a man then
the man likes a dog
	that likes a cat
	and that likes a rat
and the man likes a cow
	that likes a sheep
	and that likes a pig
		and the pig owns at most 3 cars
and the cat sees more than 3 toys
and the cat hears 3 birds
	that hear themselves.
